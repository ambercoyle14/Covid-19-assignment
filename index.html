<h1> Corona Virus Assignment by Amber Coyle </h1>

<h2> What is the Corona Virus? </h2>
    
<p> <font size="5"> A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a worldwide pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19. Symptoms of COVID-19 include :
<p>Loss of taste or smell,
<p>sore throat,
<p>nasal congestion,
<p>headaches,
<p>and aches and pains.As of today (08/2/21) there has been 107 million confirmed cases, 78.6 million recovered and 2.3 million deaths.The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing). Individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.</font></p>

    <h2> My View On CoronaVirus, Is it real or is it fake? </h2>
    <p> <font size="5">In my opinion Coorona virus is very much real. Corona virus should not be mistaken as somthing "fake" as it is a serious matter and has had a great impact on millions of peoples lives. There has been 107 million cases to date this year, 2.3 million people affected have sadly passsed away but on the brighter side 78.6 million have fully recovered. As previously mentioned Coronavirus has impacted massivley on lives, many businesses have lost their sales,unemplyment rates have sky rocketted, schools have gone remoted and much more unbelievable events. </font> </p>

    <h2> The government and their responsibilities </h2>
    <p> <font size="5"> A government is a system to govern a community/country.The Government of Ireland (Rialtas na hÉireann) is the cabinet that exercises executive authority in Ireland.The Constitution of Ireland vests executive authority in a government which is headed by the Taoiseach, the head of government. The government is composed of ministers, all of whom must be members of the Oireachtas, which consists of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. The Taoiseach must be nominated by the Dáil, the house of representatives. Following the nomination of the Dáil, the President of Ireland appoints the Taoiseach to their role. The President also appoints members of the government, including the Tánaiste, the deputy head of government, on the nomination of the Taoiseach and their approval by the Dáil. The government is dependent upon the Oireachtas to pass primary legislation and as such, the government needs to command a majority in the Dáil in order to ensure support and confidence for budgets and government bills to pass. The Government is also known as the cabinet.
                  <p> The irish government have introduced new laws since covid-19 came about to ensure that all citizens in Ireland are kept safe and to help overcome the corona virus. The government have implimented stages going from 1 to 5 with different measures in place during each stage. Information about each stage below. </font> </p>

    <h2> How was the closing of schools affected me personally </h2>
    <p> <font size="5"> In the first closure of the school last March it was hard, not just the work but coping with everything going on around the world. 2020 was a cruel year for us all. It was all new to me and not until now have I properly adapted to the new changes. The first closure was rather lonely and I was longing for the times I would see my frineds again. It felt like a never ending cycle of the government announcing every few weeks that it was not quite over yet. Although we had amazing hot summery weather, I didnt spend much of my time enjoying it but rather cooped up inside trying to manage my workload and trying to get my head around to what was truely happening - a pandemic, somthing I thought only happened in anicient history, somthing I'd only seen in the books.I missed my social life and I even admit I missed school more then ever. I missed the cold, grumpy Monday mornings with my friends, the fun classes were we coudldn't stop laughing that our ribcages hurt and even the boring classes because atleast in that moment I was in the presence of my friends and not alone in my bedroom.<p> This recent closure of school I have taken much better. I am now in a good routine and have my workload kept undercontrol, although, I admit it is still stressful as its still all quite new to me. Interactive classes have been much more helpful and it is nice to have some social interaction and teachers can explain the material in more depth and help students. Also having a time table with live classes is way better opposted to the first lockdown where I would do my work at my own leisure, which would result into my horrible sleep pattern. 
       <p>  I agree that it was a good decision to close the schools. It was the only appropriate option in my opinion, with the pandemic whch was very new to us and was the first time in our lifetimes we've faced a pandemic. It's better to be safe then sorry in these times.It was unsafe for us to keep schools open in these times as it we were facing a new deadly virus that we knew little about. All we knew was that it was seriously harming people at exceptionally fast rate and it was better to isolate.</font> </p>

    <h2> How has my social life been affected </h2>
    <p> <font size="5"> My social life this year has been very limited. As previously mentiod in <q> how school has affected me </q> the first few months since the first lockdown was hard and lonely. People say your teenage years are the best years so don't waste them - this is not what I had in mind. Summer 2020 was so fun. The restrictions eased and me and my friends went to the beach most days and enjoyed the sun. I also got my first job as a waitress - it wasn't as I expected because of the new implications. Now in 2021, we are back into another stage 5 lockdown. To keep myself sane me and two other friends go for socially distanced walks on the main beach Bundoran. </font> </p>

    <h2> The Vaccine, do I agree with the rollout plan made by the government </h2>
    <p> <font size="5">I agree with the government rollout plan. I think the goverment is right not giving everyone vaccines and putting high risk people, the older generation and healthcare workers first and I think they are working hard to do what is safe for everyone. It is important not to be selfish in times like this and to be respectable about the vulnerale people and it is only right that they get the vaccines beforehand.I have many elderly relatives and health care workers in my family and I personally would feel angered if someone who works for example in a public sector such as a cinema got the vaccination before these relatives as they are not a priority in this situation.  </font> </p>

    <h2> What am I most looking forward to </h2>
        <p> <font size="5"> The thing I am most excited for is spending 2021 summer with my bestfriends. This summer I will be 16 and I can't wait to have one of the best summers of my life. I hope the weather will be hot again like it was summer 2020. I can't wait to go to the beach everday with my friends and catch nice brown tans. I can't wait for when the days get long and it dosen't get dark till half ten. Im so excited to finish Junior cert as i'll have summer 2021 then all of ty and summer 2022 to relax from all the hard work me and my friends have put in over the years. </font> </p>
